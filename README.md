# ChatBot

Developed an intelligent chatbot that detects new messages in messenger and responds automatically 
Script dynamically reads the message, identifies tone and language style (Hinglish, Bengali mix, or English), and replies naturally in the same style.
Integrated Google Gemini (Generative AI) API to generate context-aware and natural responses.
Automated message reading, processing, and replying using pyautogui, clipboard interaction, and conditional logic.
Implemented real-time message monitoring to ensure responses are only sent when new messages arrive.
Added safety and efficiency features such as fail-safe handling, message deduplication, and concise response previews.
